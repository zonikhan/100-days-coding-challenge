//Question 113: Write a function that checks if a Map contains a key for "Canada" and logs the capital if it exists.
// Explain & TIP: You can check for the presence of a key in a Map with the .has() method and retrieve its value with the .get() method.
// Answer of Q12:
// Creates a new Map to store countries and their capitals
var countries = new Map();
countries.set("Pakistan", "Karachi");
countries.set("Qatar", "Doha");
countries.set("USA", "New York");
console.log(countries);
// Logs the Map with the countries and their capitals.
// Answer of Q13:
// This function checks for "Canada" in the Map and logs its capital
function logCapitalOfCanada(countries) {
    if (countries.has("Canada")) {
        console.log("The capital of Canada is ".concat(countries.get("Canada")));
    }
    else {
        console.log("Canada is not in the Map.");
    }
}
// Assuming countries Map from Question 112
logCapitalOfCanada(countries);
// Checks if Canada is in our Map and logs the capital if it exists.
